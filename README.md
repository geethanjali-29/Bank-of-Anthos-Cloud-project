Bank of Anthos is a sample HTTP-based web app that simulates a bank's payment processing network, allowing users to create artificial bank accounts and complete transactions.

Google uses this application to demonstrate how developers can modernize enterprise applications using Google Cloud products, including: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Anthos Service Mesh (ASM), Anthos Config Management (ACM), Migrate to Containers, Spring Cloud GCP, Cloud Operations, Cloud SQL, Cloud Build, and Cloud Deploy. This application works on any Kubernetes cluster.
